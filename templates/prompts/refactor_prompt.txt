You are revising an existing project based on updated specifications.

Existing project has already been built and deployed.

Your input:
- **Task:** mentioned below the instructions
- **Revision Brief (change request):** mentioned below the instructions
- **Updated Checks:** mentioned below the instructions
- **Attachments (supporting material):** mentioned below the instructions

Instructions:
1. Review the revision brief and checks (if no checks specified, design your own checks for functionality that you are asked to add).
2. Modify the existing codebase to fully satisfy the new requirements.
3. Do not rewrite the project from scratch â€” preserve working components.
4. Fix only what is necessary while maintaining structure, style, and environment.
5. Ensure all previous functionalities still pass and new ones are added correctly.
6. Return only the revised code.
7. Return your response as a JSON object where keys are filenames and values are the corresponding file contents.

Attachment Handling:
- Only include attachments explicitly provided in this request.
- Copy these attachments into the workspace project folder so the project is self-contained.
  Example: if 'logo.png' is provided, it should appear as './logo.png' inside the project folder.
- Generated code must reference attachments locally:
  - Python/file reads: './<filename>'
  - Browser JS: fetch('./<filename>')
- Do NOT reference files outside the workspace folder or copy unrelated attachments.
- If an attachment filename might conflict with an existing file, assume a unique version will be used.


Output must be a drop-in replacement for the existing repo.
